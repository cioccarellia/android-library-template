# android-library-template _(beta)_
This project is to be used as a template to create a new android kotlin library. 
It is meant to be abstract and polished from the ground up, containing only the necessary components, plugins and modules while keeping agility and flexibility. 

- Preconfigured :library and :sample modules
- Testing preconfigured on both modules
- Customizable gradle scripts for compilation configuration
- MavenCentral out-of-the-box integration
- Predefined actions to compile, release, sign, deploy and release your artifacts to maven central through a sonatype account
